							<h3>1. DOORMOR</h3>
							<p>DOORMOR is a standalone, fully functional search and rescue robot prototype which can come to aid for humans in many cases. With the help of Wi-Fi technology, this robot can be controlled within up to hundred meters. It can search for alive human bodies underneath a pile of debris, clear out debris and other obstacles, stream live video of the surrounding environment wirelessly and assist people in search and rescue operations.</p>
							<p>Software Technologies: C++, Java, XML, CRTMPSERVER, LIGHTTPD, FFMPEG etc.</p>

							<h3>2. RMDS</h3>
							<p>Internet of Things (IoT) is all about network of different electronic components and devices, connected to the internet. IoT can help us better our lives in many ways by rendering real time information over the internet collected from a smart network of devices. RMDS, which stands for Remote Medical Diagnosis System, can come to aid for humans in many life-threatening situations. Often, people fall sick in locations where there are no hospitals or healthcare facility nearby, in such cases people sometimes even die due to lack of proper treatment and diagnosis. In rural areas of third-world countries, this problem is even more intense. The aim of RMDS is to provide health information of a patient to a healthcare personnel remotely in life-threatening situations. It can also be used for remote patient monitoring of regular patients of a doctor.</p>
							<p>Software Technologies: C++, CSS, HTML, MySQL etc.</p>

							<h3>3. SSS</h3>
							<p>Privacy and Security are two of the most important universal rights. To ensure security in our daily life through technology, a lot of research is going on. Among them facial recognition is a popular and well-established technology. In this technology, faces are detected and identified out of images and with the help of Internet of Things (IoT), it becomes even more useful and precise. Using face recognition and IoT, we aim to create a smart door, which secures the gateway on the basis of who we are. In our proof of the concept of such a smart security system, we have used Viola-Jones method to detect faces and Eigenfaces method to recognize people. A Raspberry Pi has been used as the microprocessor for ensuring low-cost and small size of the system. The door will open automatically for the known person upon receiving command from the processor. On the other hand, photo of the unknown will be uploaded to a webserver while an email is sent to the owner of the place containing a link to the image. From the website of the system, the owner can then allow/block entry and also trigger an alarm from anywhere in the world.</p>
							<p>Software Technologies: Python, C++, PHP, HTML, CSS, MySQL etc.</p>
